# About Me

I am a first year PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Currently, I am working with Professor Francina Dominguez on research related to **extreme precipitation** within the framework of the **Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI)**.  

Before pursuing graduate school, I worked as a **meteorologist**. Since 2020, I have served as a forecaster at Iskandar Airport in Kalimantan, Indonesia, under the **Indonesian Agency of Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics (BMKG)**.  

Outside of academics, my hobbies include **painting**, and learning about **traditional music and dance**.

## What I Want to Learn

My learning goals can be divided into two aspects: **scientific** and **non-scientific**.  

### Scientific
- Generally, I want to train myself to think **logically, critically, efficiently, and effectively**.  
- Specifically, I want to become more familiar with **coding**. Although I have been exposed to coding during my studies, I have not yet practiced it efficiently and effectively as a tool for problem solving.  

### Non-Scientific
- I would like to better **balance the activities of my right and left brain** by continuing to pursue my strong interests in the arts.
