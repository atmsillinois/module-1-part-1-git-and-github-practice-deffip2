# Reflection
## What I learned
- Commits, branches, and pull requests

## Still confused
- I am still confused about the overall process and stages in using GitHub, especially how branches, pull requests, and related steps work. Because of this, I am moving very slowly while practicing Part 1 and Part 2.
